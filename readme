# Ping Pong in C

### Why?

I've wanted to explore making graphics & engines in C for a while now.. but have been too scared — and full of imposter syndrome — to do so. I finally decided last night I'd quit being a wuss and just try it! I'm having a lot of fun making my own "library" functions to make it easier for me to develop, and I think I'm finally going to make an engine (Big step, I know :P).

## Frameworks

Only GLFW & OpenGL. I did use some libraries, such as unistd & math.

## Can I use this?

Sure? It's not anything special, but if you want to snatch things, feel free! It's really basic so there's essentially completely free licensing.

## What's Next?
